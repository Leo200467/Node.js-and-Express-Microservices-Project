# Node & Express Microservices Project

## This project is used to learn the following concepts:
- Building a API using Node.js and Express;
- Redis cache for session management;
- Docker configuration;
- Docker-Compose services configuration;
- Container deployment in AWS EC2; 

The API is a simple CMS example, with CRUD operations for posts and signup/login process.
Redis is used to store and manage user session, as each post creation requires a signed user in the system.
